Machine Learning - SVMs
=======================
Used Support Vector Machines to build a facial attractiveness classifier. Solved the SVM Optimization Problem (framed as Linear Model as well as a Gaussian Model) using a general purpose convex optimization papackage (CVXPy) as well as using a customized solver known as LIBSVM
Every column represents a feature where the feature value denotes the grayscale value of the corresponding pixel in the image (there is a feature for every pixel). Each row in each of the label files gives the corresponding label (1:attractive,2: not attractive).
